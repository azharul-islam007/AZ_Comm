End-to-End System Components in Semantic Communication
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Data Preparation and Initial Knowledge Base Generation (load_dataset.py)
Terminology:
Domain-Specific Knowledge Base (DSKB): A collection of terms, entities, and their contextual meanings specific to the domain (e.g., parliamentary language in the Europearl dataset).
Redundancy Encoding: Adding extra information (| REDUNDANCY) to aid in error correction during transmission.
Function Purpose:
Extracts unique entities and terms from the dataset.
Saves the processed data with redundancy encoding for later stages.
Process:
Reads and tokenizes text from the dataset.
Creates an initial DSKB by extracting and storing terms and contexts.
Saves both the DSKB and processed data for later use.
Output: A preprocessed dataset with redundancy tags and an initial DSKB containing domain-specific terminology.
2. Adaptive Knowledge Base Update (update_dskb.py)
Terminology:
Adaptive Update: The DSKB evolves by incorporating new terms and contexts over time, adjusting to domain-specific changes dynamically.
Function Purpose:
Updates the DSKB to include new terms from additional data sources.
Process:
Reads new data and identifies terms not already in the DSKB.
Adds these terms with their frequency and contextual information.
Saves the updated DSKB to reflect recent domain knowledge.
Output: An expanded DSKB that adapts to new information, improving semantic accuracy.
3. Model Fine-Tuning for Robustness (fine_tune_model.py)
Terminology:
Noise Resilience: Model robustness against data noise (e.g., missing words, minor sentence structure changes).
AI-Based Reconstruction: Using a generative model (e.g., T5) to interpret and rephrase input into an accurate reconstruction of the original meaning.
Function Purpose:
Fine-tunes a model using the preprocessed data and redundancy to make the model more resilient to transmission errors and noise.
Process:
Uses T5 to learn to reconstruct sentences with noisy, incomplete, or redundant input.
Fine-tunes the model on augmented data with redundancy, ensuring it can handle incomplete or noisy data.
Output: A fine-tuned model capable of reconstructing text accurately, even when the input contains errors.
4. Transmission with Error Correction (transmission_utils.py)
Terminology:
Error Correction: Removes redundancy (| REDUNDANCY) after transmission to ensure the model receives clean data.
Joint Source-Channel Coding: Integrates redundancy to preserve the semantic message over potentially noisy channels.
Function Purpose:
Cleans transmitted data by removing redundancy tags, preparing it for semantic decoding.
Process:
Reads the sentence and checks for the redundancy tag.
If present, it removes the tag, leaving a clean sentence for further processing.
Output: Cleaned input that maintains semantic integrity for model processing.
5. Semantic Reconstruction with Knowledge-Based Decoding (semantic_communication_reconstruction.py)
Terminology:
Cosine Similarity: Measures semantic alignment between original and reconstructed sentences.
BLEU and ROUGE Scores: Metrics for text similarity and recall to ensure the reconstructed output aligns with the original in both structure and content.
Knowledge Base Integration: Incorporates DSKB terms during decoding to ensure domain-specific language is maintained.
Function Purpose:
Reconstructs the input into a coherent sentence that retains the original meaning.
Evaluates the quality of reconstruction by measuring semantic similarity and structural accuracy.
Process:
The model generates reconstructed text based on cleaned and semantically interpreted input.
Computes similarity metrics (cosine, BLEU, ROUGE) to assess the reconstruction’s quality.
Output: Reconstructed sentence that maintains the original’s meaning, along with similarity scores to evaluate semantic fidelity.

System as Semantic Communication vs. Traditional Communication
--------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Communication (SC) differs significantly from traditional communication methods. Here’s how this system aligns with SC principles and why it’s an improvement over traditional communication:

Focus on Meaning Over Exact Wording:

Traditional Communication: Typically prioritizes exact transmission of words or syntax (e.g., bitwise or packet-level accuracy).
Semantic Communication: Aims to preserve the meaning or intent behind the message rather than an exact word-for-word transmission.
Our System: By using a knowledge-based model and redundancy, the system focuses on reconstructing sentences that convey the intended meaning, even if the exact words or syntax change slightly.
Knowledge Base Utilization:

Traditional Communication: Rarely involves any form of domain-specific knowledge integration.
Semantic Communication: Uses a knowledge base to interpret and decode messages with context-aware accuracy.
Our System: By integrating a DSKB and allowing it to adapt, the system uses domain knowledge to decode ambiguous terms accurately, making it robust to variations in phrasing and terminology.
Error Resilience Through Redundancy and Noise Handling:

Traditional Communication: Relies on bit-level redundancy (e.g., error-correcting codes) without accounting for semantic meaning.
Semantic Communication: Adds semantic redundancy to ensure that even if part of the data is lost or corrupted, the intended meaning can still be reconstructed.
Our System: By adding | REDUNDANCY markers and training the model to handle noisy input, the system enhances error resilience while preserving semantic content.
Evaluation Based on Meaning Preservation (Cosine, BLEU, ROUGE):

Traditional Communication: Evaluation often focuses on exact matches or low error rates at the transmission level.
Semantic Communication: Evaluation is based on how closely the reconstructed text retains the original meaning, regardless of exact wording.
Our System: Uses cosine similarity, BLEU, and ROUGE scores to evaluate both the semantic fidelity and structural accuracy of the reconstructed sentences, focusing on meaning preservation.

Summary: Why This is a Semantic Communication System
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This system qualifies as a semantic communication model because it prioritizes meaning over exact word-for-word transmission. 
By using an adaptive domain-specific knowledge base, redundancy encoding, and semantic similarity metrics, it reconstructs text that retains the original intent even when faced with errors.
This end-to-end system illustrates the fundamental principles of semantic communication, making it more robust and efficient than traditional communication approaches focused on exact data replication.
